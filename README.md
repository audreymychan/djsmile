> Smile detection app based on deep learning CNN models and a pinch of dad jokes

**dfsmile** is a Flask-powered web application to showcase a smile detection algorithm trained using convolutional neural networks. It takes input from a user's webcam and returns predictions on how much they're smiling! It also provides random dad jokes from *icanhazdadjoke*'s API for fun, because why not.
